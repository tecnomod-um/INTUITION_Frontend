# UMqueries

## Overview
UMqueries (soon to be renamed) is an advanced web tool designed for exploring RDFs (Resource Description Framework) and formulating queries in a visual and intuitive way. This tool is currently being developed centered around SPARQL, but extends its capabilities with more advanced and visual features, making it easier to understand and manipulate RDF data.

## How to Use
Detailed usage instructions will be provided soon. For a comprehensive guide on how to use UMqueries, please refer to our [Usage Documentation](#) (Link to be added).
